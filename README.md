# Amz4Lib Bookmarklet

**Amz4Lib** is a bookmarklet that hides extraneous advertising information from an Amazon.com webpage and leaves only (mostly) the important bibliographic information. This allows the user to print out a sheet of paper with the information needed by a library's acquisitions department.

## Demo/Installation

To use Amz4Lib, you do NOT need to download this git repository. Simply visit our webpage (http://www6.wittenberg.edu/lib/ken/bookmarklets/amz4lib.php) and drag the bookmarklet button to your browser's bookmark bar.

If you want to contribute code to the bookmarklet, you will wish to clone or fork this repo.
